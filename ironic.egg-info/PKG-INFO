Description: Ironic
        ======
        
        Ironic is an Incubated OpenStack project which aims to provision
        bare metal machines instead of virtual machines, forked from the
        Nova Baremetal driver. It is best thought of as a bare metal
        hypervisor **API** and a set of plugins which interact with
        the bare metal hypervisors. By default, it will use PXE and IPMI
        in concert to provision and turn on/off machines, but Ironic
        also supports vendor-specific plugins which may implement additional
        functionality.
